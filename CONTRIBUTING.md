#Contributing

Everyone is free to contribute! You may fork the repository and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/charredgrass/nodejs-bot-guide/pull/new/master) if you have info that you feel should be added, or have found a mistake I made. You can also PM me on [reddit](http://reddit.com/user/charredgrass/) or [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/charredGrass/) if you have any concerns about it.
